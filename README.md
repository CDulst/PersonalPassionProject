A social experiment that allows interaction between an individual in a VR world and a person on a traditional web platform.

## Virtual Reality and social media.

This is a Quote by Mark Zuckerberg in 2014 when they bought oculus.
Facebook is a big believer in virtual reality. They believe VR is the next big step in evolving social media.

This why Facebook spends its resources on releasing accessible VR headsets over powerful ones.
An example is their currently released Oculus Quest 2.

"Facebook Horizon", The next big step in evolving social media, is also currently in invite-only beta.


## The Accessibility problem
Facebook recently admitted that VR hasn't reached the mainstream as soon as they hoped it would.
The reason why social media is so successful is primarily because it is so accessible. Everyone can access
it either through mobile devices or on PC.

Currently, 171 million people use VR worldwide and Facebook hopes that number will reach 1 billion in the near
future. VR is still a niche medium thus the dream of having people interact with each other through a virtual environment
Face-To-Face instead of through a traditional web/mobile platform is still a distant one.


## The Concept
The problem of VR being not owned by enough users therefore not being accessible enough to make VR only social media work is the painpoint my experiment is based upon.

What if we combine both virtual reality and traditional web platforms so that both people in VR and people not in VR can interact with one another.
in a unique interactive way. 

For the interactivity to truly shine. there needs to be some story telling involved aswell.

### The Story
The person in the VR Room is our test subject. He is placed inside of an experiment room where he will be tested by the experiment overseer. The person on the webapp.

Both the VR user and Web user will stand in direct contact with oneanother.
The overseer will test the test subject's abilities such as hearing, following commands, memory, reaction time, speed and so on in the form of subsequent minigames.

It will be fun for the overseer aswell.since he will be actively involved in the experiments himself. either giving commands or competing directly with the test subject.


## The Experience.

### Home (Experiment room)

#### Test Subject (VR)
Initially when starting the interactive experiment and between minigames he will be placed inside of a initial white empty room with a big screen on the end. The overseer wil be able to communicate to you through the big screen and a image and sound terminal.

User can respond to text messages with gestures (thumbs up/down, wave, ok sign...), Pick up and place objects that get spawned, listen to music that overseer uploaded using terminal and spawn images through terminal and place them on the wall.
of the room. 

The VR user can take a screenshot and send it to the overseer anytime during the experiment.


#### Overseer (Web)
On the homescreen the overseer sees a message box and a 2d canvas version of the room where the test subject is represented by a red dot.

- He can write messages and see responses of the test subject as 2d icons.

- He can upload photo's and music directly to the VR room.

- He can spawn an item from the list inside the room.

- He can change the color of lighting inside VR room.

- See screenshots taken inside vr room.

### minigame 1, Sound Commando 
This experiment wil test
- Following commands
- Hear ability
- Reaction time
- Communication 

#### Test Subject (VR)
you have a gun
object will move towards you in a fast pace from any direction.
the overseer will send you a 3D sound signal from the direction an object is flying toward you.
you need to turn around and shoot it before it reaches you.
How long can you survive? Which stage do you reach?

#### Overseer (Web)
You will see the direction the item is flying from.
You need to give a signal to the vr subject the direction it's flying from.
You can be the cause of the experiment failing if your reaction time and communication abilties are not in order.

### minigame 2, Web vs VR, A test of speed
This experiment will test
- Speed
- Reaction time
- Web vs VR

#### Test Subject (VR)
 you have a gun.
 100's of ballons will be placed all around you.
 You need to shoot as many of them as you can. beware since the test subject is popping balloons aswell.
 How many did you pop? Did you pop more balloons than the overseer?

#### Overseer (Web)
You have your mouse.
100's of balloons will be placed on your screen canvas.
you need to click 5 times on a balloon to pop them. pop as many as you can. beware since the test subject is popping balloons aswell.
How many did you pop? Did you pop more balloons than the test subject.


## Technology
### VR
* Unity
* Oculus Framework

### Web App
* HTMl/CSS/JS

### Server / Integration
* NodeJS
* Socket.IO

## The client
It's a personal experiment so the client is myself.

There is so much room for exploration and experimentation within VR since it's such a young technology with a lot of potential.

Maybe Gamedevs or Facebook itself will be able to come up with cool concepts that combines VR and webapplications in the future.
