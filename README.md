# The VR Social Experiment
A social experiment that allows interaction between an individual in a VR world and a person on a traditional web platform.

## Virtual Reality and social media.
Quote

This is a Quote by Mark Zuckerberg in 2014 when they bought oculus.

Facebook is a big believer in virtual reality and their main believe is
is that VR is the next big step in evolving social media to it's next level.

Quote

This is also the big reason why facebook spends it's recources on releasing accessible instead of powerfull vr headsets
like the currently released oculus quest 2.

"Facebook Horizon", The next big step in evolving social media is also currently in invite-only beta.


## The Accessibility problem
Facebook recently admitted that VR hasn't reached the mainstream as soon as they hoped it would.
The reason why social media is so successful is primarely because it is so accessible. Everyone can access
it either through mobile devices or on pc.

Currently their are about 171 million VR users worldwide while Facebook hopes that number will reach 1 billion in the near
future. VR is still a niche medium, the dream of having people interact with eachother through a virtual environment
Face-To-Face instead of through a traditional web/mobile platform is still a distant one.


## The Concept
The problem of VR being not owned by enough users theirfore not being accessible enough is where my passion project is based upon.

What if we combine both virtual reality and traditional web platforms. So that both people in VR and people not in VR can interact with oneanother.
that they don't get seperated and that VR can add too the already existing social media world.

In my VR Social Experiment 2 different users will stand in contact with one another.

1 is in the VR world, He within the experience is the "test subject" and he gets placed in an initial white and empty experiment room with a screen on the end.

1 is on a webapp. He is the overseer of the experiment with a fitting platform as interaction tool.


## Research Questions / How does it work?

### Communication and interaction between WebApp and VR

#### WebApp -> VR

The overseer on the webplatform can communicate and share things with the user in the VR world. Does this work?
* Text messages that appear on screen in the VR for user to read.
* Questions to answer with yes or no
* Stream Music that gets played in the VR room.
* Spawning Items
* Change lighting in room
* Share Picture/Meme that gets spawned in VR room.

#### VR -> WebApp

The person in the vr room can respond to the person on the app and also share things.
* Respond through Gestures (Thumbs up/down, headshake yes/no, fist up, middelfinger..). They translate to classic social media respond icons on the webapp.
* Decorate the room with items send by overseer.
* Take screenshots of the room and send them to the webapp.


### Tracking person in VR world.

Face-to-Face is the main selling point about virtual reality social media.

This is not possible here so let's do it in a different way.

The overseer will be able to track the location of the person within the vr room on the web app
It will be represented by a red dot on a html canvas.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this experimentation project this is a 1 on 1 experience but this would be able to be translated to many to many.

A lot of people in the outside world that would be able to share things (like social media) with people in the virtual one and the
other way around. combining existing social media with virtual reality one.


## Deliverables

### As I user in the virtual reality room I can....
* Walk around in the room without being able to escape
* Carry around object, Decorate room with objects
* Throw objects
* Perform Gestures.  (thumbs up, Headshake, middlefinger, fist up)
* Read messanges on big screen.
* See send through Messages and memes, decorate the walls
* Take screenshots of your room and send them through to the web applicatioon
* Listen to music send by overseer


### As I user on the webplatform......
* Send messages to VR room
* Upload pictures/memes en send to vr world
* Spawn object in vr world
* Upload mp3 en stream audio
* Change lighting, turn on off
* Track where the person is situated within the vr world
* Display the screenshot's that got send from the vr world.


## Technology
### VR
* Unity
* Oculus Framework

### Web App
* HTML5/CSS
* HTML Canvas
* PlainJS

### Server / Integration
* NodeJS
* Socket.IO

## The client
The client is myself since it's a Personal Experiment.

I still think there is so much room for exploration en experimentation within VR since it's a young technologie with a lot of potential.

Maybe Game devs or facebook itself will be able to come up with cool concepts that combine VR and a webapplication in the future.
