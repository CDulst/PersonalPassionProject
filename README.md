## Virtual Reality and social media.

This is a Quote by Mark Zuckerberg in 2014 when they bought oculus.
Facebook is a big believer in virtual reality. They believe VR is the next big step in evolving social media.

This why Facebook spends its resources on releasing accessible VR headsets over powerful ones.
An example is their currently released Oculus Quest 2.

"Facebook Horizon", The next big step in evolving social media, is also currently in invite-only beta.


## The Accessibility problem
Facebook recently admitted that VR hasn't reached the mainstream as soon as they hoped it would.
The reason why social media is so successful is primarily because it is so accessible. Everyone can access
it either through mobile devices or on PC.

Currently, 171 million people use VR worldwide and Facebook hopes that number will reach 1 billion in the near
future. VR is still a niche medium thus the dream of having people interact with each other through a virtual environment
Face-To-Face instead of through a traditional web/mobile platform is still a distant one.


## The Concept
The problem of VR being not owned by enough users therefore not being accessible enough is where my passion project's base lies.

What if we combine both virtual reality and traditional web platforms so that both people in VR and people not in VR can interact with one another.
Make it so they don't get separated and that VR can add to the already existing social media world.

In my VR Social Experiment 2 different users will interact with one another.

1 is in the VR world, He within the experience is the "test subject" and he gets placed in an initial white and empty experiment room with a screen on the end.

1 is on a webapp. He is the overseer of the experiment with a fitting platform as interaction tool.


## Research Questions / How does it work?

### Communication and interaction between WebApp and VR

#### WebApp -> VR

The overseer on the webplatform can communicate and share things with the user in the VR world.
* Text messages that appear on screen in the VR room for the user to read.
* Questions to answer with yes or no
* Stream music that gets played in the VR room.
* Spawning items
* Change lighting in room
* Share Picture/Meme that gets spawned in VR room.

#### VR -> WebApp

The person in the vr room can respond to the person on the app and also share things.
* Respond through Gestures (Thumbs up/down, headshake yes/no, fist up, middelfinger..). They translate to classic social media respond icons on the webapp.
* Decorate the room with items send by overseer.
* Take screenshots of the room and send them to the webapp.


### Tracking person in VR world.

Face-to-Face is the main selling point about virtual reality social media.

This is not possible here so let's do it in a different way.

The overseer will be able to track the location of the person within the vr room on the web app
It will be represented by a red dot on a html canvas.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a 1 on 1 experience but this could easily be translated to many to many.

A lot of people in the outside world would be able to share things with people in the virtual one and the
other way around. combining existing social media with a virtual reality one.


## Deliverables

### As I user in the virtual reality room I can....
* Walk around in the room without being able to escape
* Carry around spawned objects and decorate room with them.
* Throw objects.
* Perform Gestures.  (thumbs up, Headshake, middlefinger, fist up).
* Read messages on the big screen.
* See messages and memes and decorate wall with them.
* Take screenshots of your room and send them to the web application user.
* Listen to music that was send by overseer.


### As I user on the webplatform I can......
* Send messages to VR room.
* Upload pictures/memes and send to VR room.
* Spawn objects in VR room.
* Upload mp3 and stream the audio.
* Change lighting and ability turn on and off within VR room.
* Track the persons location within the VR world.
* Display the screenshots that got send from the VR world.


## Technology
### VR
* Unity
* Oculus Framework

### Web App
* HTML5/CSS
* HTML Canvas
* PlainJS

### Server / Integration
* NodeJS
* Socket.IO

## The client
It's a personal experiment so the client is myself.

Yhere is so much room for exploration and experimentation within VR since it's such a young technology with a lot of potential.

Maybe Gamedevs or Facebook itself will be able to come up with cool concepts that combine VR and webapplications in the future.
